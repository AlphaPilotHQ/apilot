## Overview

APilot is a high-performance quantitative trading framework focused on cryptocurrency and stock markets, developed by the AlphaPilot.tech team. The framework supports both strategy backtesting and live trading, providing a comprehensive solution for quantitative traders.

Official website: [www.alphapilot.tech](https://www.alphapilot.tech)

## Key Features

- **Event-driven architecture**: Built for high-performance, real-time trading systems
- **Multiple trading strategies**: Price Action strategies, Factor strategies (in development)
- **Professional execution algorithms**: BestLimit, TWAP algorithms
- **Comprehensive backtesting**: Accurate simulation with detailed performance analytics
- **Multi-exchange support**: Currently focusing on Binance, with more to come
- **Live trading capability**: Execute strategies in real-time with risk management
- **Extensible framework**: Easy to add new strategies, data sources, and exchanges

## Strategy Types

- **Price Action (PA) strategies**: Support for trend following, mean reversion, and other classic price action strategies
- **Factor strategies**: Quantitative strategies based on multi-factor models (in development)

## Technical Architecture

### Design Principles

- **Core Module**: Contains all abstract interfaces and core data structures
  - Abstract base classes (BaseEngine, BaseGateway, etc.)
  - Data models (OrderData)
  - Constant definitions (Direction, Interval, etc.)
  - Basic event system

- **Feature Modules**: Specific implementations for different domains
  - `execution/gateway/` - Exchange API implementations
  - `engine/` - Specific engine implementations
  - `strategy/` - Trading strategy templates and implementations
  - `performance/` - Performance calculation and reporting

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/apilot.git
cd apilot

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .

# Install with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

### Backtesting a Strategy

```python
from apilot.engine import BacktestingEngine
from apilot.strategy import SampleStrategy

# Create a backtesting engine
engine = BacktestingEngine()
engine.set_parameters(
    start="2023-01-01",
    end="2023-12-31",
    initial_capital=10000,
    commission_rate=0.001
)

# Add a strategy
engine.add_strategy(SampleStrategy, "MyStrategy", "BTC/USDT.BINANCE", {
    "param1": 10,
    "param2": 20
})

# Run backtest
engine.run_backtest()

# Analyze performance
engine.show_performance()
```

### Running Live Trading

```python
from apilot.engine import PAEngine
from apilot.strategy import SampleStrategy

# Create a live trading engine
engine = PAEngine(main_engine, event_engine)

# Add a strategy
engine.add_strategy(SampleStrategy, "MyStrategy", "BTC/USDT.BINANCE", {
    "param1": 10,
    "param2": 20
})

# Initialize and start the strategy
engine.init_strategy("MyStrategy")
engine.start_strategy("MyStrategy")
```
